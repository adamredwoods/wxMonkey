--------------------

NOTES

- compile the new trans.exe first, with the modified stdcpp.

- make sure the CONFIG.TXT is in the ".build" folder, and uses the CC_OPTS. Make sure the paths are set correctly.

- use wxString() function to convert to and from wxStrings and monkey Strings. wxMString is a transparent class to give errors if it doesn't match.

- you cannot override New() for any extended wx Classes. It will not allow the base class to be initiated.
  Use New(), then the Create() method in the new instance.
  
- to create a new class from an extended wx class, you will need to create some cpp glue code. most glue code is fairly simple, where it is just a name of the class, inheriting Object class (from monkey),  then empty constructors and decontructors.

- if a referenced argument is needed, use wxMonkeyRef class. this will add "&class" or "class.method"

- if a dereferenced pointer is needed, use wxMonkeyDeref class.

- if a function pointer is needed, use the function wxFuncPtr(). It creates a function pointer at monkey compile time.

- the wxApp must be global. initialise with wxMonkeyStart(app)
