wxMonkey
(c) 2012 Adam Piette
--------------------

NOTES

- compile the new trans.exe first, with the modified wxtarget, or make your own target.

- use wxString() function to convert to and from wxStrings and monkey Strings. wxMString is a transparent class to give errors if it doesn't match.
  
- if a referenced argument is needed, use VarPtr class. this will add "&class" or "class.method"

- if a dereferenced pointer is needed for passing, use Pointer class.

- if a function pointer is needed, use the function FuncPtr(). It creates a function pointer at monkey compile time.

- your wxApp must be global (or it will be GC'ed). initialise apps with wxMonkeyStart(app)

- to extend wxMonkey (if you are ambitious) and create a class from wxWidgets, you will need to create some cpp glue code. most glue code is fairly simple, where it is just a name of the class, inheriting Object class (from monkey),  then empty constructors and decontructors.
